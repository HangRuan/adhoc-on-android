You can get the entire source code of the library by using the SVN repository. If you don't know about SVN then you simply need to download a SVN client for your specific OS, from e.g. here:

http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html

Afterwards you need to start the terminal on our computer and use this command:

<b><i>svn checkout <a href='http://adhoc-on-android.googlecode.com/svn/'>http://adhoc-on-android.googlecode.com/svn/</a></i></b>

which will use the svn program download with the checkout command. This command will copy the project to your own machine. You can always get the SVN URL in order to download the source code from any Google Code project below the "source" and then "checkout". In this case it can be found here:
